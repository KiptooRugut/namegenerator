                <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
                <P>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from Ghana. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. A childâ€™s name is determined by factors
                    surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan
                    tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul.</P>
